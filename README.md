# Final-Project

An algorithm that organizes and maps out the patterns and/or trends visible in alien sightings in the past year through three different methods. 

Window.java, Window1.java, Window2.java, Window3.java. Opening Window.java should allow you to do all of the others.

List of unresolved bugs

1. No way to go back from the map or shapes buttons
2. Random Text in the middle of Window1

Compile and run Window.java

Run Window.java and click on the option you'd like to pursue

Recommended: 

1. Click the "Choose a date" button
    
    By choosing a month and day you will see one sighting from that day while the rest of the sightings from that day will appear in your terminal.
2. Click back when you are done
3. Click either the map or shapes button and see the information
4. Close the window
5. Run Window.java again and pick the button you have not yet pressed
